My name is Yash and I have fun building websites using Reactjs. I try to focus on improving my Front End skills but sometimes I get side tracked by 
some of the latest cool trends with Full stack development. I'm currently looking for a role in Front End development, which can help me elevate my 
Front End skills with styling, animations or 3D. I'd love an opportunity to be part of a team that takes websites above and beyond that might also
leave a positive lasting impression on a user.
